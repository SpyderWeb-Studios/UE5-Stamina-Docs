# Stamina Component

This is the main component that handles the system. It replicates the Stamina values to the clients and listen server.


These 2 functions are what you will be using in Blueprints to interact with the component on a basic level. 
```c++
/**
* @brief RPC to toggle stamina on the Server
 * @param bEnableStamina If the client is requesting the stamina to be enabled or disabled
 */
UFUNCTION(Server, Unreliable, BlueprintCallable, Category="Stamina|Toggle")
    void Server_ToggleStaminaActive(bool bEnableStamina);

/**
 * @brief Server Only Function to toggle stamina on the Server. Should be used over the RPC equivalent when possible.
 * @param bEnableStamina If the client is requesting the stamina to be enabled or disabled
 */
UFUNCTION(BlueprintAuthorityOnly, BlueprintCallable, Category="Stamina|Toggle")
    void ToggleStamina(bool bEnableStamina);
```

This is also where the Stamina Regenerate variables are stored, so you have a central place to balance these values. The function to regenerate the stamina is also blueprint callable so you can call it wherever you may need to.

Finally, the final major feature of this component is the ability to calculate if a certain action is viable with the amount of stamina left. This is support you to make your own components that communicate with the `Stamina Component`, such as for heavy attacks or other actions that require the usage of stamina
